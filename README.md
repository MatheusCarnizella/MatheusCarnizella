Hello, I'm Matheus Carnizella Nepomuceno, I'm 25 years old and I'm passionate about technology and programming. I'm a .NET Developer with experience only in developing custom systems out of pure desire to train and increase any and all desirable knowledge.

I have training in the area of exact sciences as a Bachelor in Chemistry and Technician in Plastics, where I had no attachment to enjoy the area, but I maintain the vast knowledge acquired.

I completed the Generation .NET Developer Full Stack Bootcamp to raise the learning level further. I know how to work using agile methodologies (SCRUM) and taking advantage of the soft skills that I stand out as: teamwork and persistence, to improve my interpersonal connection. I am flexible and always seek to acquire new knowledge and stay connected with the best practices and technologies in the market.

I have the characteristic of always seeking excellence, everything and anything to add I seek to complete, if you need an answer I deliver the answer, if I don't know the answer I try to find it. Even so, I keep practicing all the knowledge acquired and always putting it on Github for confirmation.

I always loved practicing English. Although most of the practices were on my own, I always trained in reading and listening by training with articles, books, websites, music and movies to maintain proficiency.


Thanks to watching me !
